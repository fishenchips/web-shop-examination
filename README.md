This is a school [Medieinstitutet](https://medieinstitutet.se/) examination project, where I will build a web shop.

Products are from [Platzi Fake Store API](https://fakeapi.platzi.com/en/rest/products)

I will continue to work on this project after school submission. [This is the submission version](https://github.com/fishenchips/web-shop-examination/tree/ad57e0285d0b443f5a1f9aba02babe2f53f7718c)

## Getting Started

First, clone the project:
git clone https://github.com/fishenchips/web-shop-examination.git

Second, install needed packages:
npm install

Third, run the development server:
npm run dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Styling

Some css classes will include _all: revert_ to go back to intial css styling and not use chakra UI.

## Requirements

You need access to my MongoDB stored data, and I can provide that should you ask!
